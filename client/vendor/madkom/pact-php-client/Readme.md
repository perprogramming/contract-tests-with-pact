### What is Pact
Pact is [consumer driven contract](http://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html). Is a way to define contract between consumers and provider.  
It help to keep your provider's API compatible with your consumers.

### Pact-Php-Client
Is client for [pact-mock-service](https://github.com/bethesque/pact-mock_service). Which is just implementation of [Ruby Pact](https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact).  
Your tests against provider can be run as part of your Continues Integration system.   
For more information about how does Pact works go here [pact wiki](https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact/wiki) and here for [microservices overview](http://dius.com.au/2016/02/03/microservices-pact) 


### How to use Pact-Php-Client
